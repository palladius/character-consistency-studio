# Character Consistency Studio - User Manual

Welcome to the Character Consistency Studio! This guide will walk you through the main features of the application.

## Core Concepts

The primary goal of this tool is to help you create consistent images of a specific person or character across various styles and scenarios. You provide a set of reference images, and the AI uses them to understand the character's appearance when generating new pictures.

## 1. Creating a Character

-   **Add a Character**: To begin, click the `+` icon in the top-right of the "Characters" panel on the left sidebar.
-   **Name Your Character**: Give your character a distinct name (e.g., "Alice", "Cyberpunk Detective").
-   **Upload Reference Images**: Once your character is created and selected, you'll see a "Reference Images" section. You must upload at least 3 high-quality images of the character's face from different angles. For best results, use 5-10 images.

## 2. Generating Images

Once you have uploaded at least 3 reference images, the generation panel will become active.

-   **Use the Prompt Box**: Type a description of the scene you want to create. For example: "A photo of Alice as a superhero, cinematic lighting."
-   **Use Suggestion Buttons**: For quick ideas, click on one of the suggestion prompts below the input box. The app will automatically combine it with your character's name and generate an image.

## 3. Viewing and Editing Images

All of your generated images appear in the "Generated Images" grid.

-   **View Image Details**: Click on any generated image to open a full-screen detailed view. Here you can see the prompt used, the image dimensions, and download or copy the image.

### Enhance Quality Button

The **Enhance** button is a powerful tool for improving your generated images.

-   **What it does**: When you click "Enhance", the app sends the image back to the AI with a specialized instruction: *"Enhance the quality of this image. Increase sharpness, improve lighting, refine details, and add more realism without changing the content or composition."*
-   **The Result**: You get a new version of the image that is often sharper, clearer, and more detailed. It's like applying a professional "touch-up" filter. The AI does **not** change the subject or the scene; it only improves the visual quality of what's already there.

### Editing with Prompts

-   You can also perform custom edits. In the image detail view, use the "Edit Image" text box to describe a change, like "add a retro filter" or "change the background to a forest." The AI will generate a new version with your requested changes.

### Image History

The app keeps track of your edits. In the detail view, you can see the "parent" of an edited image and any "children" created from it, allowing you to easily navigate your creative process.
